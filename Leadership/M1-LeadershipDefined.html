    <!-- Updated Palette: "Blue Gradient Harmony" - Professional palette using blue gradients and cool tones. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured into four thematic, scrollable sections to create a narrative user journey: 1) "The Essence of Leadership" introduces the core definition through interactive cards. 2) "The Evolution of Leadership" uses an interactive timeline to show historical context. 3) "Core Competencies" features an interactive chart and detailed cards to explore essential skills. 4) "Your Leadership Journey" provides interactive tools for self-reflection (roles and personal definition). This thematic structure was chosen over a linear report format to make complex information more digestible and engaging, allowing users to explore concepts at their own pace and focus on areas most relevant to them. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Leadership Definition -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Method: Interactive HTML/CSS cards -> Interaction: Click to reveal details -> Justification: Breaks down a dense definition into memorable, bite-sized pieces. 2) History of Leadership -> Goal: Show Change -> Method: Interactive Timeline (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click on eras to display details -> Justification: Visually represents the progression of theories, making it easier to understand than plain text. 3) Competencies -> Goal: Compare/Inform -> Method: Bar Chart (Chart.js) & Cards -> Interaction: Hover on chart, click on competency categories -> Justification: The chart provides a quick visual comparison of competency importance, while the cards offer deeper insights. 4) Leadership Roles -> Goal: Compare/Organize -> Method: Tabbed content (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click tabs (Coach, Mentor, Sponsor) -> Justification: Allows for easy side-by-side comparison of distinct but related roles. -->
