            <div class="note-card">
                <p>Leadership is fundamentally about <strong>relationships with other people</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Kari Keating:</strong> Leadership comes down to interpersonal relations, especially <strong>one-on-ones</strong> and the ongoing effort of <strong>building and cultivating trust</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Elizabeth Luckman:</strong> Trust is the <strong>foundation</strong>. It's crucial for navigating both good and bad situations and for building <strong>psychologically safe environments</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Trust Development:</strong> Built in "drops" over time, but lost in "buckets." It's an ongoing, never-ending process.</p>
                <p><strong>Individual Relationships:</strong> Even in a team of ten, a leader has unique relationships with each person, requiring individual building, not just treating the team as a collective unit.</p>
                <p><strong>Ted Lasso Example:</strong> Illustrates building different types of trust with individual team members and owning up to mistakes to prevent losing trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Conflict:</strong> Natural part of human interaction due to different perspectives. Trust helps navigate conflict better, fostering innovation and creativity.</p>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Leadership is an interaction based on trust. Acknowledge when you diverge from your "best self," engage vulnerably, and use these moments to strengthen relationships and navigate conflict for group performance.</p>

        <!-- Lesson 1: Leading with Emotional Intelligence -->
        <section id="emotional-intelligence">
            <h2 class="section-title">Lesson 1: Leading with Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h2>
            <div class="note-card">
                <h3 class="sub-section-title">What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</h3>
                <p><strong>EQ vs. IQ:</strong> While cognitive intelligence (IQ) is important, emotional intelligence (EQ), or socio-emotional skills, is <strong>foundational to building trusting relationships</strong> and effective, ethical leadership.</p>
                <p><strong>Definition (Salovey & Mayer, 1990s):</strong> EQ is "an ability to monitor the feelings of ourselves and others, to discriminate among those feelings, and to use this information to guide thinking and action."</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Four Branches of EQ (in order of complexity):</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>1. Emotional Perception & Expression:</strong> Identifying emotions in self and others (facial expression, tone, body language, cultural artifacts) and expressing emotional needs. Essential first step.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Using Emotion to Facilitate Thinking:</strong> Emotions prioritize attention. Understanding optimal emotional states for targeted outcomes helps adapt to situations.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Emotional Understanding:</strong> Ability to understand and differentiate emotional states, recognizing the relationship between words/emotions, causes, interpretations, and predictions of emotions.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. Emotional Management (Self & Others):</strong> Most advanced skill. Remaining open to a wide range of emotions (pleasant/unpleasant) and reflectively regulating emotions for emotional and intellectual growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Case Study: Mora's Story (Lack of EQ)</h3>
                <p>Mora, a senior manager, poorly communicated a new Saturday work requirement from her VP to her team, resulting in frustration and a breakdown of trust due to her lack of EQ.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Perception & Expression:</strong> Mora failed to perceive and express her own emotions regarding the VP's news and ignored her team's emotional cues (sinking faces, crossed arms, sighs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Using Emotion:</strong> Did not use her own (frustration, injustice, shame) or her team's emotions to foster connection or problem-solve. She adopted an assertive, defensive stance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Misinterpreted her managers' feelings as an "angry mob" instead of confusion, injustice, curiosity, or fear. Lacked empathy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Slammed hands, shouted, and stormed out, failing to stay open to unpleasant feelings and missing chances to build trust, manage conflict, and foster team culture.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Cognitive Override:</strong> In "fight, flight, freeze" situations, leaders need to consciously suspend impulsive behaviors to maintain a calm, open, and curious approach.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Importance of Emotions in the Workplace:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Traditional view of checking emotions at the door is <strong>ineffective</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Research shows we are <strong>emotional creatures</strong>; burying emotions leads to resentment, inauthenticity, and conflict.</li>
                    <li>Leaders must <strong>model transparency and authenticity</strong> about their feelings, including vulnerability, to create psychological safety for others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Benefits of EQ:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Works with IQ to <strong>impact job performance</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Correlated with <strong>organizational citizenship behavior</strong> (e.g., helping colleagues, showing resilience).</li>
                    <li>Linked to <strong>employee satisfaction, leader authenticity, better mental/physical health, well-being, and happiness</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contagious</strong> due to the brain's limbic system; a leader's mood impacts those around them and the organization's bottom line.</li>
                    <li>Fosters <strong>innovation and creativity</strong> by enabling deeper trust and real conversations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Developing EQ:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>EQ is an <strong>ability, not a fixed trait</strong>, so it can be developed through practice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experts & Tools:</strong> Marc Brackett ("Permission to Feel"), Susan David ("Emotional Agility"), Brené Brown ("Dare to Lead," "Atlas of the Heart"), Daniel Goleman ("The Emotionally Intelligent Leader"), Richard Boyatzis, Annie McKee, Fran Johnston ("Becoming a Resonant Leader").</li>
                    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Personal reflection, awareness, understanding nuances of emotions, labeling emotions, identifying triggers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oscar Ybarra:</strong> EQ models need to be more user-friendly. With practice, emotional responses can become more automatic, freeing up cognitive resources. Context and social situations significantly influence EQ application.</li>
                    <li>Despite chaotic leadership environments, making time for <strong>reflection and practice</strong> of EQ skills leads to well-trained routines that are more likely to be used under pressure, enhancing leadership potential.</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Lesson 2: Building Trusting Relationships</h2>
            <div class="note-card">
                <p><strong>Trust</strong> is a relational factor that leaders can develop to increase <strong>employee satisfaction, commitment, and meaningful engagement</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Jeffrey Loewenstein:</strong> Trust aligns goals, fosters cooperation, and eases work. Low trust requires monitoring, contracts, and controls. High trust leads to familiarity, informality, open sharing, and optimal solutions without holding back information.</p>
                <p>Organizations with high trust cultures show <strong>high quality work outcomes, less stress, more energy, and increased productivity</strong>.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Defining Interpersonal Trust:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Confidence that another will <strong>not harm you</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Corresponding <strong>willingness to be vulnerable</strong> with that person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foundational</strong> to successful interpersonal relationships at work.</li>
                    <li>Comprises <strong>warmth/positivity</strong>, <strong>predictability</strong>, and <strong>vulnerability</strong> (trusting they won't use it to tear you down).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">The ABI Model of Trust (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity):</h3>
                <p>Individuals are more likely to trust someone if they perceive these three skills:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Ability:</strong> Perceived <strong>competence</strong> of a leader; delivering results, having training/experience, self-awareness of what they know/don't know, and curiosity for learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benevolence:</strong> Perceived <strong>concern for the well-being of others</strong>. Leaders should demonstrate care, avoid belittling, and be responsible for employees' mental health and support when "chips are down."</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Perceived <strong>consistency of behavior</strong>; doing what they promised. Following through on commitments builds future trust.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">This model is <strong>iterative</strong>, with each skill reinforcing the others.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Why Leaders Should Focus on Trust:</h3>

                            <li><strong>1. Confrontational Inquiry:</strong> Inserts own ideas in question (e.g., "Didn't you agree?"). Can gain consensus or be coercive.</li>
                            <li><strong>2. Diagnostic Inquiry:</strong> Tries to understand what the other person is thinking/feeling at the moment (e.g., "How do you feel about that?").</li>
                            <li><strong>3. Process Inquiry:</strong> Questions about the conversation process itself (e.g., "Are we at a good stopping point?").</li>
                            <li><strong>4. Humble or Pure Inquiry:</strong> Accessing one's own lack of knowledge; total curiosity without judgment (e.g., "Why?", "Tell me more."). Demonstrates respect.</li>

                <p><strong>Jeffrey Loewenstein:</strong> Avoid seeing others as "tools" or "means" to achieve outcomes, which is dehumanizing. This reduces effort, initiative, productivity, and belonging. Instead, engage as humans, acknowledging their beliefs, desires, joys, and despair. This builds respect and trust, leading to a strong, effective, and productive culture.</p>
                <p>Trust is about recognizing everyone's humanity, that we are all learning, and are worthy of trust and respect. This is powerful for leadership relationships.</p>

            <div class="note-card">
                <p>Leaders have <strong>formal authority/power</strong> or influence others. Effective leaders understand power/influence, how to harness it, and use it <strong>ethically</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Kari Keating:</strong> Leadership is at its core <strong>influence</strong>. Everyone has the capacity to influence. Influential people listen empathetically and offer human-to-human guidance/coaching.</p>
                <p>Any relationship has a <strong>power dynamic</strong> (formal, positional, or shifting influence). Power is a <strong>responsibility</strong> and can be abused, even unintentionally.</p>

                    <li><strong>4. Expert Power:</strong> Unique expertise, particular skills, or experience (doesn't require a title).</li>
                    <li><strong>5. Referent Power:</strong> Comes from being respected, liked, and trusted (cultivated by anyone).</li>

                    <li><strong>Command-and-Control Leadership:</strong> Telling instead of empowering problem-solving (e.g., Jim Luckman's abusive boss example).</li>
                    <li><strong>Inhibited Inclusivity/Belonging:</strong> Power makes leaders turn inward, reducing perspective-taking and empathy. Leaders must explicitly create opportunities for others to voice opinions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fear of Losing Power:</strong> Viewing power as a valuable resource leads to putting up "armor" to protect it, pushing people away, and failing to build trust or be empathic (Jeffrey Loewenstein's "armor" analogy).</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Lesson 4: Navigating Differences of Opinion: Negotiation and Conflict</h2>
            <div class="note-card">
                <p>Organizations are made of diverse individuals; <strong>disagreements and conflict are normal and natural</strong> parts of group process.</p>
                <p>Leader's job: Understand disagreements and help others navigate differences productively.</p>
                <p><strong>Denise Lewin Loyd:</strong> Strong leadership is <strong>inclusive</strong>, recognizing and incorporating diverse perspectives (departments, backgrounds) and individual motivations.</p>
                <p>This section explores <strong>negotiation</strong> and <strong>managing conflict</strong> as foundational concepts.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Negotiation:</h3>
                <p>Broader than just haggling for price. It occurs "when we are trying to <strong>interdependently reach a decision</strong>" (Jeffrey Loewenstein).</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Examples: Deciding dinner with a friend, team project strategy, projects with supervisor, even parent/child interactions ("eat your broccoli").</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Principles of negotiation can apply to virtually any interdependent decision-making process.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Three Primary Goals of Negotiation (Jeffrey Loewenstein):</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>1. Create Value:</strong> Expand the "pie" by understanding each party's <strong>interests</strong> (what's important), not just positions (what they say they want). Making trade-offs based on interests (e.g., orange story: one wants peel, other wants fruit). Effective negotiation starts with understanding everyone's interests to find a decision that provides more value.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Claim Value:</strong> Deciding who gets which part of the expanded "pie." Conflict may arise here. Claiming value is more effective when parties first focus on creating value.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Cultivate Relationships & Reputation:</strong> Recognize that interdependent decision-making requires <strong>trusting relationships</strong>. Hard bargaining tactics (bluffing, manipulation) are ineffective long-term as they destroy trust. Honest negotiation fosters transparency and better future outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Conflict:</h3>
                <p>At its core, conflict is simply when <strong>two people disagree</strong>. Can be problematic or productive if managed correctly.</p>
                <p>Effective leaders create inclusive environments by providing space for <strong>healthy and productive conflict</strong>.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Ron Myers:</strong> Conflict is not necessarily bad. We often fail at conflict because we don't dialogue. Leaders have a responsibility to create a <strong>safe space for dialogue</strong>, which resolves conflict by taking away dehumanization and focusing on shared understandings, even if agreeing to disagree.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Three Types of Conflict:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>1. Task-Based Conflict:</strong> Differences of opinion on work tasks (e.g., project decisions, hiring candidates).
                        <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-8 mt-2 space-y-1">
                            <li>Often stems from underlying assumptions or different goals.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2. Relationship Conflict:</strong> Stems from individual differences (personalities, communication styles, conflict management styles).
                        <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-8 mt-2 space-y-1">
                            <li>Focus on commonalities: shared experiences, goals, or tendencies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>3. Values-Based Conflict:</strong> Differences in individual values, deeply held assumptions (cultural, ethical, political, religious views).
                        <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-8 mt-2 space-y-1">
                            <li>Not solved by logical discussion.</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Lois Boxill:</strong> Damaging people by failing to see their differences. Inclusive leadership means recognizing individual differences and not lumping people together; checking biases by paying attention to the person in front of you.</p>

            <div class="note-card">
                <p>Effective navigation of differences involves: <strong>self-awareness</strong>, <strong>communication strategies (trust-building)</strong>, and <strong>focusing on interests (not positions)</strong>.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">1. Self-Awareness (How you approach negotiation/conflict):</h3>
                <p>Understand your emotional stance and assumptions before a "hard conversation."</p>
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-2">Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI) - Five Conflict Management Styles:</h4>
                <p>Based on two dimensions: <strong>Assertiveness</strong> (satisfy own needs) and <strong>Cooperativeness</strong> (satisfy others' needs).</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Avoiding (Low Assertiveness, Low Cooperation):</strong> Leaves discussion, sidesteps issues, placating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accommodating (Low Assertiveness, High Cooperation):</strong> Ignores own concerns to satisfy others; overly generous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competing (High Assertiveness, Low Cooperation):</strong> Focus on own concerns, defending position, manipulating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborating (High Assertiveness, High Cooperation):</strong> Pays attention to both concerns, explores interests, seeks win-win solutions, creative problem-solving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compromising (Moderate Assertiveness, Moderate Cooperation):</strong> Finds a "good enough" solution for both; less creative than collaborating.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">The goal isn't to pick one style, but to develop <strong>self-awareness</strong> of your natural tendencies and adapt your style based on situational factors.</p>
                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Oscar Ybarra:</strong> Acknowledge potential miscommunication when working with diverse backgrounds (e.g., engineer vs. marketing). Awareness of initial challenges and eventual benefits of diverse perspectives is crucial.</p>
                <p>Observe your <strong>tone</strong> (calm, patient, aggressive, curious) as it conveys a lot of information.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">2. Communication Strategies (Asking Questions & Sharing):</h3>
                <p>An open dialogue requires both <strong>asking questions</strong> and <strong>sharing vulnerabilities</strong> to demonstrate a willingness to work together.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Aravinda Garimella:</strong> Actively ask about <strong>interests</strong> to learn unspoken thoughts, and also to give people opportunities to reflect on what they want (as they may not know themselves).</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">3. Focusing on Interests, Not Positions:</h3>
                <p>Remember the person you disagree with is a human being with hopes, values, and goals.</p>
                <p>Leaders need to help others see the capacity to work through differences together.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Jeffrey Loewenstein:</strong> Today's status quo is an <strong>achievement</strong> built on shared understanding and routines. Psychological safety lowers the threshold for vulnerability and allows for risky debate/discussion about "the song" (the task) without threatening individual standing or relationships.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Practice over time builds relationships, develops norms for creating value, and encourages honest communication, making discussions easier.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Module Wrap-up: Ongoing Leadership Journey</h3>
                <p>Leadership involves heavy and critical topics: emotions, power, influence, and ethics. It's a continuous journey requiring a <strong>growth mindset</strong>.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Kari Keating:</strong> Continuously <strong>ask for feedback</strong> (even mid-career) to check how you're "showing up" and to use power/influence ethically and develop EQ. Seek "loving critics."</li>
                    <li><strong>Elizabeth Luckman:</strong> Focus on <strong>"loving critics"</strong> (trusted individuals with your best interests at heart) for both positive and negative feedback, using it as a mirror for growth rather than isolated criticism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Denise Lewin Loyd:</strong> Cultivate a <strong>self-critical voice that comes from a space of self-love</strong>, focusing on objectives and constructive feedback. Recognize the inherent difficulty and vulnerability in giving/receiving feedback, especially across different cultural norms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dean Brown (interviewed by E. Luckman):</strong> Leaders must learn to <strong>navigate criticism</strong> because it's a constant part of holding authority. Vulnerability means recognizing you'll "mess up" and seeking help to improve.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">Leadership is a "weird dance" requiring constant processing of information, vulnerability, self-awareness, and a growth mindset.</p>
